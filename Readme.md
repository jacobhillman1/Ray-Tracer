Lightbox
========

The is a simple template project for making a raytracer project in C++.

It contains a subset of [geomc](https://github.com/trbabb/geomc) with most of the shapes and tracing functions removed (since implementing those is the whole point!). Still available are vectors, matrices, quaternions, and rects/ranges.

Requirements
============

This project requires [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html), [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) (for libpng), and [boost](http://www.boost.org/).

The Makefile is POSIX, but the code can be compiled on other platforms.
