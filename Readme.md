Ray Tracer
==========

This is a simple Ray Tracer implemented in C++. The boilerplate for this project was forked from Tim Babb's "lightbox". The project depends on a subset of [geomc](https://github.com/trbabb/geomc) (Tim Babb's own mathematical library) with most of the shapes and tracing functions removed. 

Requirements
============

This project requires [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html), [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) (for libpng), and [boost](http://www.boost.org/).

The Makefile is POSIX, but the code can be compiled on other platforms.
